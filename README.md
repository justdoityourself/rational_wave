# rational_wave
A modern C++ template library to inspect wave-forms.

## Proof of concept stage

This code was written to validate some matrix transformation I was studying.

It is able to isolate waves from a wave-form without any data loss or corruption.

* Documentation
* Spectrum Scan
* Cleanup copy and paste Memory and ManagedMemory dependencies.
